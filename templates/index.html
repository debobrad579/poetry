            <p>
                I sit with another version
                <br>
                of myself eating this apple
                <br>
                and this apple. I see
                <br>
                myself bite, chew,
                <br>
                and swallow as I bite,
                <br>
                chew, and swallow. I cannot
                <br>
                read me, my other face
                <br>
                consumed in eating this apple.
                <br>
                In my sinus there is a buzzing
                <br>
                like a dying fluorescent light
                <br>
                that drowns this apple I’m eating.
                <br>
                I cannot tell if this other me
                <br>
                hears it, if I see me
                <br>
                seeing me chewing and lost.
                <br>
                I would be fine if I stayed confined
                <br>
                to this, to sitting and eating.
                <br>
                I grow concerned when I see me
                <br>
                on the train and getting
                <br>
                off at the wrong stop, leaving me
                <br>
                bewildered in the tunnel. Worried
                <br>
                when I see myself driving my car
                <br>
                and veering it into traffic. Alarmed
                <br>
                at the beach when I watch me
                <br>
                walk into the water calm with
                <br>
                stones in my pockets when there
                <br>
                are no stones in my pockets.
                <br>
                Curious when I sit and write
                <br>
                when I’ve had no pen in hand in weeks.
                <br>
                And every time I try to ask me
                <br>
                I’m gone before I get there.
            </p>

            Above is a pixel art picture I made on a 128px by 128px digital canvas using the software: Aseprite. I used Python with Flask for the back end, HTML and CSS for the front end, and deployed everything to Heroku. I chose to create a pixel art image because that is an art form that I already new; I chose to display this all on a website because I new it wouldn't take long since I had already made 8 this past year, and it's more interesting than displaying everything on a google document. Now to my interpretation of the meaning: the speaker is sitting, and he is physically there, but he's not mentally there. The speaker is dissociating from his current activity, hence the name. When he tries to do things: to write, he is there, but his mind isn't; he's imagining another version of himself: another thing that could have happened or could happen. I related this to my own feelings of dissociation; I imagine myself closer to where I feel at home: to where I don't feel anxious. I imagine myself feeling happiness: looking towards the light; but in reality, I'm looking away: I'm not happy.
